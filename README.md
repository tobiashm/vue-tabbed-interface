# Tabbed Interface as a Vue 3 component

This is a low level implementation of the [Tabs design pattern from WAI-ARIA](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#tabpanel).

It aims to provide the structure and behaviour of a tabbed interface, without applying any styling.

You can then use this as a basis for building your own Tabs component.
